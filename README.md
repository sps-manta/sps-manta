- 👋 Hi, I’m @sps-manta
- 👀 I’m interested in classical music, pipe smoking, BBQ cooking, and running.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Python programming for work-related projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python coding tasks, especially those that benefit from a controlled and precise approach.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a father of seven and have been married since 2000!
